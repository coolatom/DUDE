# DUDE!

## **A simple chat application with encryption features.**

### This project was a simple implementation of the idea of a secure web application for communication. The next thing was the idea to make a closed chat for the [LGBT community](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=+LGBT+community).

### But, over time, it acquires new features and grows into a full-fledged secure chat application

## Main tools used:
1) HTML DOM;
2) JavaScript;
3) REACT app building;
4) NODE server creating;
5) MongoDB a DataBase management;
6) yarn requests and commnds;

**During the development of this project, I managed to familiarize myself with:**
>- basic principles of working with versions;
>- establishing communication between the client and server part;
>- working with JavaScript hooks;
>- application of stylization of text input forms;
>- adding various decorative functionality;

and the work continues.

## Development led me to learn the basics of design using Figma.
